<h4 style="color: green">General FAQ'S</h4>

<p style="color:#00CC00">What do I need to bring to practice?</p>
<p>Each player should come to practice with an inflated soccer ball, soccer shoes, tennis shoes and shin guards. Sports Zone does offer refreshments, including beverages and snacks, which can be purchased. You may also bring your own beverages from home. Snacks on the playing field are not permitted, but can be consumed off the field.</p>

<p style="color:#00CC00">Where do you hold your training sessions and programs?</p>
<p>Soccer Sense hosts Player Development Programs at Sports Zone, located at the Monroe 33 Sports Center. The physical address is 4 Farrington Boulevard, Monroe, NJ 08831. For GPS Directions, use 1320 Perrineville Road, Monroe Township, NJ 08831</p>

<p style="color:#00CC00">How do I know which program to register my child for?</p>
<p>Register your child for the age appropriate Player Development Program.</p>

<p style="color:#00CC00">Do you have a limit on size of your classes?</p>
<p>It is our experience that players develop best in a small peer group, led by a team of professional coaches. This is why we limit registration for each session to 10-14 players. Typically we allow no more than 2 makeups per each 1 hour session to ensure the benefits of one-on-one coaching opportunities and the benefit of team play. This is why it’s so important for our Scheduling Coordinator to be contacted regarding absences and makeups.</p>

<p style="color:#00CC00">If my child can only attend a portion of the training sessions, should we register anyway?</p>
<p>Soccer Sense’s Player Development Programs are specifically designed to help every player reach their maximum potential. In order to bring each child to the next level of play, it is vital that they attend the regularly scheduled training sessions. This will help them hone their current skills and acquire new ones. Regular attendance is also the best way for coaches to evaluate progress and provide recommendations and suggestions for improvement. Players who regularly miss practice sessions or only participate in a portion of the season’s sessions do not often see the same benefit as those in regular attendance.</p>

<p style="color:#00CC00">What kind of payment plans do you offer?</p>
<p>In conjunction with Sports Zone, Soccer Sense offers safe and convenient online registration and payment.</p>

Will Coach Williams train my child privately?
<p>Coach Williams and his team of professional coaches limit the number of Player Development Attendees to 10-12 per session so that each player can receive the benefits of one-on-one coaching, as well as team and peer practice sessions.</p>

<p style="color:#00CC00">How do you feel your coaching/training is different than others?</p>
<p>Every player begins their athletic career as an individual, which is why Soccer Sense coaches players to develop their technical skills as an individual first. Once those skills are mastered, we work with the players to help them develop tactically in a small group setting.</p>

<p>I would like to watch my child practice from the sidelines during the practice session. Why can’t I come onto the practice field?
While we respect the work you do as parents to mold bright, healthy and productive children, it is our job as coaches to help them reach their maximum potential, on and off the field, by attending our specially designed Player Development Programs. These programs instill confidence and empowerment; develop leadership skills, teamwork and respect. In terms of modeling respect, we ask that you respect our coaching staff by remaining outside the practice area and off the field, unless specifically asked by your child’s coach to enter the practice area or field. Your children will be dismissed by their coaches.<p>

<div id="year" class="container">
<h4 style="color: green">Year Round FAQ'S</h4>

<p style="color:#00CC00">Can I be reimbursed if my child is unable to make up any missed sessions?</p>
<p>All makeup sessions should be scheduled with our Scheduling Coordinator and completed within the same 12 week season as the missed session. Missed sessions are not reimbursable.</p>

<p style="color:#00CC00">What is your reason to have mixed age training/mentors?</p>
<p>It is our experience that new or younger players develop best through the motivation and education of their peers, as well as an excellent Coaching Staff. These peer trainers serve as role models, giving the younger players something to aspire to.</p>

<p style="color:#00CC00">If my child misses a training session, when can that session be made up?</p>
<p>All missed sessions must be made up within the current 12 week session. Please contact our scheduling coordinator at develop@soccersense.net. Provide your child’s name, age, regular training session and your availability for a makeup session in your email.</p>

<p style="color:#00CC00">What is your policy if a training session falls on a holiday?</p>
<p>If your child’s practice session falls on a holiday, that session will be cancelled and a makeup session will be scheduled. If your child is unable to attend the scheduled makeup session, simply contact our Scheduling Coordinator at develop@soccersense.net, providing your child’s name, age, regular training session and your availability for a makeup session.</p>

<p style="color:#00CC00">How long does each practice session last?</p>
<p>Each field session is geared toward an hour of practice time. Immediately following the field work, players retreat to a stretching area with Coach Williams and his staff. It is during this time that players are stretched and cooled down to avoid injuries. This also offers the Coaches an opportunity to review what the players learned during that day’s session.</p>

<p style="color:#00CC00">Why is Coach Williams not always coaching every session?</p>
<p>Each Coach brings his/her own unique perspective to the field and practice session, while embracing the Soccer Sense philosophy. Coach Williams has personally selected every member of his Coaching Staff, which guarantees their shared philosophy, training and exacting standards of soccer.</p>

<p style="color:#00CC00">I feel that my child is an advanced player and I would like to register him/her for a different session than recommended on your website.</p>
<p>Being the parent of an athlete is truly an enjoyable experience. As a parent, you’ve had the privilege of watching your child progress as his/her soccer prowess grows. And while it’s your job to be a proud cheerleader for your player, we recommend all players begin in the recommended age group. This will give our Coaches an opportunity to properly evaluate the child’s skill sets and level of play with his/her own peers. If your child would benefit from being placed with a different age group, one of our professional Coaches will discuss that with you and your child.</p>

<p style="color:#00CC00">How much practice should children do at home to balance your training?</p>
<p>Practicing at home is imperative to developing the skill sets needed for your child to reach their maximum potential. However, we do not want to over-train our players. At home practice should consist of technical skill building, in addition to any new skills learned at the previous week’s practice session.</p>

<div id="summer" class="container">
<h4  style="color: green">Summer Program FAQ'S</h4>

<p style="color:#00CC00">How do you design your summer programs to parallel with the yearly training?</p>
<p>Our Summer Player Development Programs offer players the opportunity to practice their skills in a very demanding environment. This competitive environment encourages technical and tactical prowess. The Summer Programs are a continued complement to our very successful Year Round Player Development Program.</p>

<p style="color:#00CC00">Which summer program should my child participate in?</p>
<p>We recommend all players begin in the recommended age group. This will give our Coaches an opportunity to properly evaluate the child’s skill sets and level of play with his/her own peers. If your child would benefit from being placed with a different age group, one of our professional Coaches will discuss that with you and your child.</p>

<p style="color:#00CC00">What are the prerequisites for attending the summer programs?</p>
<p>Any child may attend our Summer Development Programs, regardless of age and soccer experience. However, in order to register for the Achiever Programs, the child must have participated in at least one 12-week session during that year.</p>
